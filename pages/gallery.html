                  This picture was taken in budapest, Hungary. budapest is one
                  of the most beautiful citites in europe and the Danube River
                  falls right in the middle of the city, the atmosphere is
                  always enjoyble there no matter the time, there are also many
                  other attractions in this city but i felt that having a
                  picture of the second largest river in europe was worth
                  sharing.

                  calming and sweet, even those ducks were just chilling there

                  This picture was taken in Aeigna island in Greece, it is one

                  greek history and it is 2 hours away from the port of athens.
                  fun fact about this island is that cars are not allowed on it
                  and you can only use donkeys to move around.
